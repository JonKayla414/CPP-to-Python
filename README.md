# cplusplus-Program

This project was solving how to use Python and C++ to Ask a user to make a menu menu selection. According to what the user Selected thr program would either, Read , print and store data from "inputfile.txt", display or make a historgram and store it in "frequency.dat", or read and display data from "frequency.dat"

I think I was able to handle the user input well. I have a function that checks the value and handles any errors. For example when the user is supposed to type an interger 1-5 if the user enters a number then the program will not crash due to the input not being an integer.

I think I could enhance my code by using C++ more. I thinnk it would make my program run faster.

I think the pieces of  the code that was most challenging was my python code because I had to go back into my notes that I took in my python class. I haven't used python in 3 years so this was a challange because I am not familiar with the syntax anymore. I think reading my python code was most challenging. My computer would not seem to read it properly. A fix was using Py_Object* Path and Py_object * sys. 

The skils that is transferrable to other projects is using python and C++ together. This made my program a lot more organzied and effective.

I made this program readable by keeping the main function short and using other functions. This made it easy to debug. In addition I used comments to keep myself on track on what I needed to do. This also helps it be maintable and adaptable because it is easier for others to understant what I wrote.
